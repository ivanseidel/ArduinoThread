/*
 	ThreadController.h - Controlls a list of Threads with different timings

	Basicaly, what it does is to keep track of current Threads and run when
	necessary.

	ThreadController is an extended class of Thread, because of that,
	it allows you to add a ThreadController inside another ThreadController...
