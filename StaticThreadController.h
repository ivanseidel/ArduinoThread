/*
	StaticThreadController.h - Controlls a list of Threads with different timings

	Basicaly, what it does is to keep track of current Threads and run when
	necessary.

	StaticThreadController is an extended class of Thread, because of that,
	it allows you to add a StaticThreadController inside another kind of ThreadController...

	It works exact as ThreadController except you can't add or remove treads dynamically.

	Created by Alex Eremin, September, 2016.
	Released into the public domain.
